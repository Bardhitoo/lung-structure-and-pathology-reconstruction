    1. Interactive 3D Reconstruction of Pulmonary Anatomy
        - Conclusions: For performing complex segmentectomy of the lower lung lobe, the procedure of 3D reconstruction may shorten the operation time, decrease the number of stapler reloads, prevent postoperative air leakage, and guarantee a safe surgical margin. Therefore, 3D reconstruction is recommended for complex segmentectomy of the lower lung lobe.
