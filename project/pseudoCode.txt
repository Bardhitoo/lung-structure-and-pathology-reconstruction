# Load scan the CT scan (Read the .mhd file)

# Threshold values outside of scan to equal the values of air (so we can ignore them)

# Resample to isomorphic pixels (x,y,z) -> (1,1,1)

# Segmenting the lungs
    # Values of the lungs have usually values -500HU
    # binary_image -> Binarize the image at -320HU
    # labls -> connected components with 4 neighbors

    (To get the irrelevant pixels that are surrounding the circular in the scan)
    # Find the background labels around circle
        # get width, height, and depth of scan
        # stroke_thickness -> 2
        # radius1 -> w/2 (square image)
        # radius2 -> radius1 - stroke_thickness
        # center -> width / 2

        # Create a meshgrid with the size of the image
        # Get the distance from the center using pythagorean theorem

        # Create mask1 with values <= than radius1
        # Create mask2 with values <= than radius2

        # Create final mask by mask1 xor mask2
        # Create a 3D version of the mask
        # Get the labels from those locations by multiplying the labels with the mask

    # Invert the image
    # Get the connected components again
    # Find the most used label in there -> convert it to 0 (air)

    # Return binary image

# Plot_3D(scan, threshold):
    # Transpose so the head is always up
    # Get the vertices & faces from marching_cubes(scan) method
    # Create the mesh from Poly3DCollection
    # Plot it
