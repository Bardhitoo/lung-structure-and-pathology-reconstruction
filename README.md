# Lung Nodule Detection and 3D Reconstruction Pipeline

This project presents a pipeline for the three dimensional reconstruction of lung anatomy and pathology using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques. The pipeline consists of several stages including image pre-processing, feature extraction, and model training and evaluation. 

The computer vision component detects and segments lung nodules within CT scans `LungScan`, while the machine learning component trains models for nodule detection `<yet to come>`. 

A 3D reconstruction module `Mesh` is also included, creating detailed 3D models of the lung, airways, and potential nodules, which can be analyzed for signs of malignancy based on nodule shape, location, and proximity to airways.

The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung nodule detection and lung and airway reconstruction, with the potential to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of oncologists and improve patient outcomes.
